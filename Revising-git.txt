i am revising the git cmds for my projects coming up


git init  -> for master
git init -b main -> for main 

git status -> for checking the status of the repo

git add FILENAME -> add to the staging area
git add .-> adds all the files into staging area

git commit -> to commit without message

:qa! to exit the commit

git commit -m OUR COMMIT message

git log -> see the history i think 

git commit -a -m message -> Stages the file and commits

git diff -> Track the changes in the file in the working directory
git diff --staged-> Track the changes in the file in the staging area

Readme.md -> markdown

git --cached FILENAME -> to remove a file which is in staging area

git clone LINK -> clone a project

echo "# write something " >> README.md -> this echo the entire thing in the 
quotes into the README.md file / appends the message into the file 

cat README.md used to see the content of the file 


git branch -M main -> creates a branch called mian to the master

ssh-keygen -o -> this makes no login to push

i am revising the git cmds for my projects coming up


git init  -> for master
git init -b main -> for main 

git status -> for checking the status of the repo

git add FILENAME -> add to the staging area
git add .-> adds all the files into staging area

git commit -> to commit without message

:qa! to exit the commit

git commit -m OUR COMMIT message

git log -> see the history i think 

git commit -a -m message -> Stages the file and commits

git diff -> Track the changes in the file in the working directory
git diff --staged-> Track the changes in the file in the staging area

Readme.md -> markdown
